JS System changes
	As it currently stands, a lot of the old functionality has gone out, with newer stuff put in it's place.  A lot of the old SE functions have changed to be replaced with item properties.  Here is a list:
	Documentation updates WILL be made in the next week, so that people can get a firmer grasp on things.

Item properties
	New property	Old Function
	============================
	name		GetName / SetName
	title		GetTitle / SetTitle
	x		GetX / SetX
	y		GetY / SetY
	z		GetZ / SetZ
	id		GetID / SetID
	colour		GetColour / SetColour
	owner		GetOwner / SetOwner
	visible		GetVisible / SetVisible
	serial		GetSerial / SetSerial
	health		GetHealth / SetHealth
	scripttrigger	GetScriptTrigger / NewScriptTrigger
	worldnumber	GetWorldNumber / SetWorldNumber
	amount		GetAmount / SetAmount
	container	GetContainer / SetContainer
	type		GetType / SetType
	more		GetMore / SetMore
	morex		GetMoreX / SetMoreX
	morey		GetMoreY / SetMoreY
	morez		GetMoreZ / SetMoreZ
	movable		GetMovable / SetMovable
	att		GetAtt / SetAtt
	def		GetDef / SetDef
	layer		GetLayer / SetLayer
	lodamage	GetLowDamage
	hidamage	GetHiDamage
	name2
	isChar
	isItem
	race
	raceID

for simplicity, let's take an example.  Old style code might look like:

	var iID = GetID( iSwung, 1 );
	iID = iID + 5;
	SetID( iID, iSwung, 1 );

You could replace that with:

	iSwung.id = iSwung.id + 5;

Thus, we're now on a PROPERTY system.
