	Updated some packet notes from what I could scrounge through the net (Maarc)
	Added basic CPIMetrics class to read in the 0xD9 packet that gets sent (Maarc)
	Fixed a logging issue with CPCharAndStartLoc that wasn't taking the extra characters into account (Maarc)
	Fixed a logging issue with CPCharAndStartLoc that was trying to dump out location details as ASCII codes, not as strings (Maarc)
	Added a feature to packet logging so that it will fill a line of less than 8 bytes to 8 bytes, to even out it's display (Maarc)
	CPISecondLogin logging claimed to be packet 0x80, when in reality, it's 0x91 (Maarc)

	Changed CPICreateCharacter::Log to dump out hex values for body/skin colours (Maarc)
	Added some preliminary support for elvish bodies (Maarc)
	Needs doing: Adding random names list 3 (elf male) and 4 (elf female) for incognito (Maarc)
	Updated gender IDs 0 == human male, 1 == human female (as before).  2 == elf male, 3 == elf female, 0xFF == unknown.  Potentially has JS impacts! (Gender property) (Maarc)
	Note: Need to experiment with gender values with CPStatWindow (see code notes)
	Note: isHuman() doesn't even evaluate current dead bodies, what is the impact?
	Renamed validHair() to validHairStyle() because we want to validate colour as well (Maarc)
	Added a CanSee() routine to JS based socket and character objects.  Syntax is as follows (Maarc)
		sourceObject.CanSee( otherObject );
		sourceObject.CanSee( targX, targY, targZ );
		otherObject can be either a character, item or socket.  If they're not on the same world or the target item is in a container, line of sight fails.
	Proper validation of hair style on creation of elvish characters (Maarc)		
	Moved checkkey(), processkey() and cl_getch() from uox3.cpp into CConsole methods (Maarc)
	Added a key/command handler console exposure to the JS environment (involves a secondary runtime because of threading!) (Maarc)
	Note: Creating/editing world objects through this environment is not thread safe, and may cause errors
	Modified Console.PrintDone() and Console.PrintFailed() to take an optional boolean parameter as to whether it is printed instantly, or queued up (Maarc)
	Added functions Console.BeginShutdown() and Console.Reload( intVal ) (Maarc)
		BeginShutdown() takes no parameters
		Reload() takes a single parameter, with the values of
			0	Reload INI
			1	Reload Accounts
			2	Reload Regions
			3	Reload Spawn Regions
			4	Reload Spells
			5	Reload Commands
			6	Reload Definition Files
			7	Reload JS
			8	Reload HTML
	Couple of prettying up with the loading code and what it displays (Maarc)

	Fixed a dyed underwear issue with newly created players (Xuri)
	Fixed a bug with clumsy JS (visibility not resetting properly) (Maarc)
	Added JS implementation for heal and feeblemind (Maarc)
	Added JS implementation for magic arrow, but it relies on MagicDamage(), which is not completely implementable (missing Karma, Fame and CPDisplayDamage) (Maarc)
	Added a ValidateObject() function to the JS engine, that behaves the same as it does in the C++ code (Maarc)
	Updated 'set command to support setting of health (via health or hp) (Maarc)
	NOTE: Tweak seems to be broken (the buttons don't fire anything), and I have no idea why (Maarc)
	NOTE: Heal is currently a vampiric heal (some health is subtracted from the caster to heal the target).  This is *not* a new behaviour. (Maarc)
	NOTE: Tweaked up magic arrow damage (a GM mage was doing less than 4 damage every time).   (Maarc)
	Old magic arrow formula			
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 1 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1 (maximum multiplier, 1.5)
		Damage Dealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck
	New magic arrow formula (JS Only!)
		baseDamage	= 2 + Random( 0, 5 )
		mageryMult	= (Magery / 2000) + 1
		DamageDealt	= baseDamage * mageryMult - EvalIntCheck
	The EvalInt check has changed, as well (with the JS code, not the C++ code.  All non-JS spells still adhere to this old standard). (Maarc)
	Previously, a successful check would always draw off a fixed amount of damage ( 10% of your skill level ) (Maarc)
	Adjusted the JS socket property for characters, so that it returns an explicit NULL object if there is no socket attached (Maarc)
	NOTE: Researching into JSExtendedClass instead of JSClass, so that we can implement equality testing (like, attacker != caster sorts of things) (Maarc)
	Hungercheck for players should now be working again (Grimson)
	OnHungerChange JS event will now execute both for hunger level increase as well as decrease, and will also work as global script (Grimson)	
	Some fixes for the onHungerChange code to ensure UOX3 doesn't crash when no global script is defined (Grimson)
	Added isAnimal and isHuman as JS character properties. (Maarc)
	Minor code change in tempeffects(). (giwo)
	Updated the version number to reflect recent changes by Maarc and Xuri. (giwo)
	Fixed an issue causing JS Skills not to function if a character had a script assigned to him. (giwo)
	Fixed some minor issues with LineOfSight(). (giwo)
	Began to break LineOfSight() into smaller manageable functions. (giwo)
	Renamed SeekMap0() to SeekMap() to better represent it's ability to seek any map file. (giwo)
	More fixes for const correctness. (giwo)

JScript Changes/Fixes:
	Added feedback message for the dupe-command (Xuri)

	Made us of the JS Method CanSee() for LoS checks in JS magic functions. (giwo)
