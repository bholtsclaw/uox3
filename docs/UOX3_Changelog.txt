	Fixed an issue causing Ghosts to "collide" with other players.
	Fixed an issue causing smelted ingots to not be stackable.
	Changed JS event onCreate() to onCreateTile() and onCreateDFN()
		Note that onCreateDFN() will be the default, only items added directly
		from the tile will use onCreateTile(). These scripts can be either scriptID 0
		or specified in harditems.dfn.

DFN Fixes:
	Instead of 21 location-dfn files, we now have only one; location.dfn.
	Added ingots and gold to harditems.dfn to safeguard against stacking issues.
